# Atomic vector..........

# An atomic vector is just a vector of data.
# I can make an atomic vector by grouping some values of data together with c:

die <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
die

# is.vector
# is.vector tests whether an object is an atomic vector, It returns TRUE if the
# object is an atomic vector and FALSE otherwise.

is.vector(die)

# I can also make an atomic vector with just one value. R saves single values
# as an atomic vector of length 1:

five <- 5
five
is.vector(five)

# length
# "length" returns the length of an atomic vector 

length(five)
length(die)

# Each atomic vector stores its values as a one-dimensonal vector, and each atomic
# vector can only store one type of data. I can save different types of data in 
# R by using different types of atomic vectors. Altogether, R recognizes six
# basic types of atomic vectors: doubles, integers, characters, logicals,
# complex, and raw.

# TO create my card deck, i will nees to use different types of atomic vectors
# to save different types of information(text and numbers).
# I can do this by using some simple conventions when i enter my data.
# I can create an integer vector by including a capital "L" with my input.
# I can create a character vector by surrounding my input in quotation marks:

int <- 1L
text <- "ace"

# Each type atomic vector has its own convention. R will recognize the convention
# and use it to create an atomic vector of the appropriate type.
# Use the same convention with each element:

int <- c(1L, 5L)
text <- c("ace", "hearts")

# Vector types help R behave as i would expect. For example, R will do math with
# atomic vectors that contain numbers, but not with atomic vectors that contain
# charactor strings:

sum(int)
sum(text)

# Doubles...........................

# A double vector stores reguler numbers. The numbers can be positive or negative,
# large or small and have digits to the right of the decimal place or not.
# In general, R will save any number that i type in R as a double.
# The die i made was a double object.
# I can ask R what type of object an object is with "typeof":

die <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
die
typeof(die)

# Integers..........................

# Integer vectors store integer, numbers that can be written without decimal
# component. As a data scientist i won't use the integer type very often because
# i can save integers as a double object. I can specifically create an ineger in
# R by typing a number followed by an uppercase L.

int <- c(-1L, 2L, 4L)
int
typeof(int)

# Note that R won't save a number as an integer unless i include the L. Integer
# numbers without the L will be saved as doubles.
# The only difference between 4 and 4L is how R saves the number in my computer's
# memory.

# Characters.........................

# The individual elements of a character vector are known as strings.
# Note that a string can contain more than just letters.
# I can assemble a character string from numbers or symbols as well.

text <- c("Hello", "World")
text
typeof(text)
text1 <- c("1", "2")
typeof(text1)

# Logicals............................

# Logical vectors store TRUEs and FALSEs, R's form of boolean data.
# Logical are very help fro doing comparisons.

3 > 4

# Any time i type TRUE or FALSE in capital letters, R will treat my input as
# logical data. R also assumes that T and F are shorthand for TRUE and FALSE,
# unless they are defined elsewhere.

logic <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
logic
typeof(logic)
typeof(F)

# Complex and Raw......................

# Complex vectors store complex numbers. Tp create a complex vector,
# add an imaginary term to a number with i:

comp <- c(1 + 1i, 1 + 2i, 1 + 3i)
comp
typeof(comp)

# Raw vectors store raw bytes of data. Making raw vectors gets
# complicated, but i can make an empty raw vector of length n with raw(n).

raw(3)
typeof(raw(3))

# Vector of cards........................

# Create an atomic vector that stores just the face names of the cards
# in royal flush.
# For example, the ace of spades, king of spades, queen of spades, jack
# of spades and ten of spades.
# The face name of ace of spades would be "ace", and spades is the suit.

hand <- c("ace", "king", "queen", "jack", "ten")
hand
typeof(hand)

# This creats a one dimensional group of card names.

# Attributes..............................

# Let's make a more sophisticated data structure, a two dimensional table
# of card names and suit
# I can build a more sophisticated object from an atomic vector by giving
# it some attributes and assigning it a class.
# An attribute is a piece of information that i can attach  to an atomic
# vector or any R objects.
# I can see which attributes an object has with "attributes".
# "attributes will return NULL if an object  has no attributes.

attributes(die)

# R uses NULL to represent the null set, an empty object.
# NULL is often returned by functions whose values are undefined.
# I can a NULL object by typing NULL in capital letters.

# Names.........

# The most common attributes to give an atomic vector are names,
# dimensions(dim), and classes. Each of this attributes has its own 
# helper function that i can use to give attributes to an object. I can
# also use the helper functions to look up the value of these attributes
# for boject that already have them. For example, i can look up the
# value of the "names" attribute of die with "names":

names(die)

# NULL means that die does not have a names attribute. I can give one to
# die by assigning a character vector to the output of names. The vector
# should include one name for each element in die:

names(die) <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six")

# Now die has a name attribute

names(die)
attributes(die)

# R will display the names avobe the elements of die whenever i look at
# the vector:

die

# However, the names won't effect the actual values of the vector, nor
# will tha names be affected when i manipulate the values of the vector:

die + 1

# I can also use "names" to change the names attribute or remove it all
# together. To change the names, assign a new set of levels to names:

names(die) <- c("uno", "dos", "tres", "quatro", "cinco", "seis")
die

# To remove the names attribute, set it to NULL:

names(die) <- NULL
die

# Dimensions(Dim).....................

# I can transform an atomic vector into an n-dimensional array by giving
# it a dimensions attribute with "dim". To do this, set the "dim"
# attribute to a numeric vector of length n.
# I can recognize die into a 2 X 3 matrix (which has 2 rows and 3 columns)

dim(die) <- c(2, 3)
die

# Or, 3 X 2 matrix (which has 3 rows and 2 columns)

dim(die) <- c(3, 2)
die

# Or a 1 X 2 X 3 hypercube (which has 1 row, 2 columns, 3 "slices")
# This is a three-dimensional structure, but R will need to show it slice
# by slice by slice on my two-dimensional computer screen:

dim(die) <- c(1,2,3)
die

# Matrices........................

# Matrices store values in a two-dimensional array. First give "matrix"
# an atomic vector then define how many rows should be in the matrix by
# setting the "nrow" argument to a number. I can set the "ncol" argument
# which tells R how many columns to include in the matrix:

m <- matrix(die, nrow = 2)

# "matrix" will fill up the matrix column by column by default, but i can
# fill the matrix row by row if i include the argument byrow = TRUE:

m <- matrix(die, nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
m

# The "array" function creats an n-dimensional array. For example, I could
# use "array" to sort values into a cube of three-dimensions or a hypercube
# in 4,5 or n dimensions. "array" is not as customizeable as matrix and
# basically does the same thing as setting the "dim" attribute. To use
# array, provide an atomic vector as the first argument, and a vector of
# dimensions as the second argument, now called "dim"

ar <- array(c(11:14, 21:24, 31:34), dim = c(2, 2, 3))
ar

# Create a matrix, which stores the name and suit of every card in royal flush

hand1 <- c("ace", "king", "queen", "jack", "ten",
                "spades", "spades", "spades", "spades", "spades")
hand1

# Individually each line of code make hand1 to a 5 X 2 matrix

matrix(hand1, nrow = 5)
matrix(hand1, ncol = 2)
dim(hand1) <- c(5, 2)

# I can also start with a character vetor that lists the cards in a slightly
# different order. In this case, i wll need to ask R to fill the matrix
# row by row instead of column by column:

hand2 <- c("ace", "spades", "king", "spades", "queen",
           "spades", "jack", "spades", "ten", "spades")
hand2
matrix(hand2, nrow = 5, byrow = TRUE)
matrix(hand2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# class.....................................

# Notice that changing the dimensions of my object will not change the type
# of the object, but it will change the object's class attribute:

dim(die) <- c(2, 3)
typeof(die)
class(die)

# Note that an object's "class" attribute will not always appear when i
# run attributes. I may need to specifically for it with "class"
# Notice that the "class" of a double is "numeric". The most important
# property of a double vector is that it contains numbers.

attributes(die)
class("Hello")
class(5)

# Dates and times.......................

# The time looks like a character string when i display it, but its data type is 
# actually "double", and its class is "POSIXct" "POSIXt (It has two classes):

now <- Sys.time()
now
typeof(now)
class(now)

# POSIXct is a widely used framework for representing dates and times. In the
# POSIXct framework, each time is represented by the numbers of seconds that
# have passed between the time and 12:00 AM January 1st 1970 (in UTC)
# R creates the time object by building a double vector with one element. I can
# see this vector by removing the "class" attribute of now or by using the
# "unclass" function.

class(now) <- NULL
now
unclass(now)  # OR

# R function will use the POSIXct standard to convert the time into a user
# friendly character string before displaying it.

mill <- 3452373634
mill

class(mill) <- c("POSIXct", "POSIXt")
mill

# Factors.............................

# Factors are R's way of storing categorical information like ethnicity, eye color.
# To make a factor, pass an atomic vector into the "factor" function. R will
# recode the data in the vector as integers and store the results in an integer
# vector. R will also add a "levels" attrubute to the integer, which contains
# a set of levels for displaying the factor values and a "class" attribute.

gender <- factor(c("male", "female", "female", "male"))
typeof(gender)
attributes(gender)

# I can see exatly how R is storing my factor with "unclass":

unclass(gender)
gender

# I can convert a factor to a character string with "as.character":

as.character(gender)

# Each atomic vector can only store one type of data. As a result, R coerces
# all of my values to one type of data.

card <- c("ace", "hearts", 1)
card
typeof(card)
class(card)

# I can explictly ask R to convert data from one type to another with "as":

as.character(12)
as.logical(12)
as.logical(-0.56)
as.numeric(FALSE)

# Another type of object: LIST..........................................

# "list" group data into a one-dimensional set.
# "list" do not group togather individual togather; "list" group togather
# R object, such as atomic vectors and other list.
# I can make a "list" that contains a numeric vector, character vector, and a
# new list with the "list" function:

list1 <- list(100:130, "R", list(TRUE, FALSE))
list1

# I can store a playing card in a very simple list

card <- list("ace", "hearts", 1)
card

# I can save a deck of playing cards as a list of 52 sublists. But there's a
# much cleaner way to do the same thing. I can use a special class of list,
# known as "data frame".

# A class of list: Data Frame.........................

# Data frames are the two-dimensional version of list. Data frames group
# vectors together into a two-dimensional table. Each vector becomes a column
# in the table. Every column in data frame must be the same length. Each
# column can be a different data type.

df <- data.frame(face = c("ace", "two", "six"),
                 suit = c("clubs", "clubs", "clubs"),
                 value = c(1, 2, 3))
df

# I named the arguments in "data.frame" face, suit, value. "data.frame" will
# use my argument names to level the column of data frame.

# I can also give names to a list or vector when i create one of these objects

list2 <- list(face = "ace", suit = "hearts", value = 1)
list2
typeof(list2)
class(list2)

vect <- c(face = "king", suit = "spades", value = 10)
vect
typeof(vect)
class(vect)

# Each data frame is a "list" with class "data.frame". I can see what types of
# objects are group togather by a "list" or "data frame" with the "str" function:

typeof(df)
class(df)
str(df)

# R Saved my character string as factors. I can prevent this behavior by 
# adding the argument "stringsAsFactors = FALSE" to data.frame:

df <- data.frame(face = c("ace", "two", "six"),
                 suit = c("club", "club", "club"),
                 value = c(1, 2, 3), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
df
str(df)

# Data frame is a great way to build an entire deck of cards. I can make each
# row in the data frame a playing card, and each column a type of value.

f <- c("king", "queen", "jack", "ten", "nine", "eight",
          "seven", "six", "five", "four", "three", "two", "ace")
face <- c(f, f, f, f)

s1 <- c("spades","spades","spades","spades","spades","spades",
           "spades","spades","spades","spades","spades","spades","spades")
s2 <- c("club","club","club","club","club","club",
           "club","club","club","club","club","club","club")
s3 <- c("diamond","diamond","diamond","diamond","diamond","diamond",
           "diamond","diamond","diamond","diamond","diamond","diamond","diamond")
s4 <- c("hearts","hearts","hearts","hearts","hearts","hearts",
           "hearts","hearts","hearts","hearts","hearts","hearts","hearts")

suit <- c(s1, s2, s3, s4)

value <- c(13:1, 13:1, 13:1, 13:1)

deck <- data.frame(face, suit, value, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
deck

# Loading data from a coumputer file.............................

# I can load a csv file from my computer with the "read.csv" function:

deck <- read.csv("G:/Programming/deck.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# When i import a data set, Rstudio will save the data to a data frame. I can
# open any data frame in a view tab with the "view" function:

View(deck)

# "head" will return just the first six rows of the data set, and "tail" will
# return just the last six rows. To see a different number of rows, give
# "head" or "tail" a second argument, the number of rows i would like to vies.

head(deck)
tail(deck)
head(deck, 10)
tail(deck, 10)

# Saving data to my computer............................................

# I can save any data frame in R to a .csv file with the command "write.csv".

write.csv(deck, file = "card.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# R will turn my data frame into a plain text-file with comma-seperated values
# format and save the file to my working directory.
# To see where my working directory is:

getwd()

# Selecting  Values.........By Positive Integers............

# To exract a value or set of values from a data frame, write the data frame's
# name followed by a pair of hard brackets. Between the brackets will go two
# indexes seperated by coomma. R will use the first index to sebset the rows
# of the data frame and second index to subset the columns.
# In R indexing begin at 1.

# Selecting the element of the first row and frist column

deck[1,3]

# Selecting the element of the first row and 1,2,3 column

deck[1, 1:3]

deck[c(1,2), c(1,2,3)]

# R will give a new set of values which are copies of the orginal values and
# i can save them to a new vector.

new <- deck[1, 1:3]
new

# if a repeat a number in my index, R will return the corresponding values more
# than once in my subset. This code will return the first row of deck thrice.

deck[c(1,1,1), c(1,2,3)]

# I can use the same syntax to select values in any R object. One index for
# each dimension. I can subset a vector (which has one dimension)  with a single
# index:

vec <- c(6, 3, 5, 3, 6, 7, 2, 10)
vec[1:3]

# drop = FALSE

# If i select a single a column, R will return a vector.

deck[1:2, 1]

# If i would prefer a data frame instead, i can add the optional argument
# drop = FALSE between the brackets:

deck[1:2, 1, drop = FALSE]

# Selecting values.............By Negative integers...........

# R will return every element except the elements in a negetive index. For
# example this code will return everythig except the first row of deck:

deck[-1, 1:3]

# This code will return the first row and exclude everything.

deck[-(2:52), 1:3]

# Selecting values by blank speces..................
# I can use a blank space to tell R to extract every value in a dimension. This is
# useful extracting entire rows or columns from a data frame.

deck[ ,1, drop = FALSE]
deck[1, ]

# Selecting values by logical values.................
# If i supply a vector of TRUEs and FALSEs as my index, R will match each TRUE
# and FALSE to a row or column in my data frame. R will then return each row or
# column that corresponds to a TRUE.

deck[1, c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)]

rows <- c(T,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,
          F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,
          F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F,F)
deck[rows, ]

# Selecting values by names...........................

deck[1, c("face", "suit", "value")]
deck[ , "value"]

# Deal a card.......................................
# Make a function that returns the first row of a data frame

deal <- function(card){
  card[1, ]
}

deal(deck)

# A function that returns any row of deck data frame.
# If i do not pass a number in this function, it will return the whole data frame

# To shuffle the deck, i need to randomly reorder the rows in the data frame.
